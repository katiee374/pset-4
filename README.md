# PSET 4: Recurison
## Part 1: Understanding & Writing with Recursion
In this first part of the assignment, you should work to understand the 
purposes of recursive methods and reading through how they work. Answer the 
questions in PartOne.txt and PartOne.java before moving on. PartOne.java may be 
tricky, so you should consult TA office hours early and give your mind time 
to work through the puzzles.

Goals:
 * Understand recursive methods and trace recursive calls by hand.
 * Demonstrate an understanding of recursive logic.
 * Gain a thorough understanding of some classic introductory recursion 
   examples.
 * Work on generating recursive logic independently.

## Part 2: Iteration vs. Recursion & Reflection
In class, we've discussed how recursion and iteration serve the same purpose. 
In this part of the assignment, you will rewrite an iterative method using 
recursion and explore the differences in performance between iteration and 
recursion. Complete the exercise in PartTwo.java and reflection in 
PartTwo.txt.

Goals:
 * Understand the relationship between iteration and recursion.
 * Understand why recursion or iteration may be a better fit for certain 
   problems.
 * Understand the value of recursive logic and learning it early in CS.
 * Compare and contrast recursion and iteration to see why iteration is not 
   the best approach to every problem.
