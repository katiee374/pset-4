# PSET 4: Recurison
## Part 1: Understanding Recursion
### Description:
    In this first part of the assignment, you should work to understand the purposes of recursive methods and walking through how they work. Answer the questions in PartOne.txt before moving on to Part 2. This assignment is best done in order.
### Goals:
 * Understand recursive methods and trace recursive calls by hand.
 * Demonstrate an understanding of recursive logic.

## Part 2: Writing Recursive Methods
### Description:
    In this part of the assignment, you will work to solve some classic recursion puzzles. You will gain the most from this assignment if you attend TA office hours early on and give your mind time to work through these puzzles. Fill in the methods in PartTwo.java.
### Goals:
 * Gain a thorough understanding of some classic introductory recursion examples.
 * Work on generating recursive logic independently.

## Part 3: Iteration vs. Recursion
### Description:
    In class, we've discussed how recursion and iteration serve the same purpose. In this part of the assignment, you will rewrite an iterative method using recursion and explore the differences in performance between iteration and recursion. Complete the exercise in PartThree.java and reflection in PartThree.txt.
### Goals:
 * Understand the relationship between iteration and recursion.
 * Understand why recursion or iteration may be a better fit for certain problems.

## Part 4: Reflection
### Description:
    In this final part of the assignment, we would like you to reflect on the benefits of learning recursion. What will you take away from this lesson? When is recursion useful or not so useful? Compare iteration and recursion.
    Complete this task in PartFour.txt.
### Goals:
 * Understand the value of recursive logic and learning it early in CS.
 * Compare and contrast recursion and iteration to see why iteration is not the answer to every problem.
