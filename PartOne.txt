Trace the following recursive methods. Explain in your own words what they do, 
and answer the question provided by tracing the method by hand.
1. public void mystery(int[] arr, int i) {
        if (i < 0)
            return;
        System.out.println(arr[i]);
        System.out.print(i);
        mystery(arr, i-1);
    }
What does the call mystery(arr, 5); print when arr={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}?

2. public int mystery(int x) {
        if(x <= 5) {
            return 12;
        }
        return mystery(x-2) * mystery(x-1);
    }
What does the call mystery(7) return? Include the value of x and what is 
returned at each recursive call.
